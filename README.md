## What This App Does

This is a web-based hotel booking system that lets users manage hotel room reservations, event space reservations, guests, and optional room upgrades. It was built as a full-stack application that connects to a PostgreSQL database we designed in Phase 1 and 2.

The app supports:
- Browsing and managing hotel guests
- Viewing rooms by type and availability
- Booking rooms for overnight stays (with check-in/check-out dates)
- Reserving event spaces by the hour
- Adding optional upgrades to room reservations (breakfast, late checkout, extra bed, airport transfer, parking, spa access)
- Cancelling reservations
- Preventing double-bookings for rooms and spaces

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Library:** pg (node-postgres)

## Database Schema

The database has 7 tables based on our ER diagram:

- `Guest` — stores guest info (name, email, phone)
- `RoomType` — room categories with capacity and base price (Standard, Deluxe, Suite, Executive, Family, Penthouse, Accessible)
- `Room` — individual rooms with floor and status
- `Space` — event spaces with capacity and hourly rate
- `Upgrade` — optional add-ons for room reservations
- `RoomReservation` — room bookings linked to a guest and room
- `SpaceReservation` — space bookings linked to a guest and space
- `RoomReservationUpgrade` — bridge table linking upgrades to room reservations

## How to Run

### 1. Set up the database

```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE hotel_db;"
psql -U postgres -d hotel_db -f phase2.sql
psql -U postgres -d hotel_db -f insert.sql
```

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
cd hotel-backend
npm install
node index.js
```

Runs on `http://localhost:3001`. Update `db.js` with your PostgreSQL credentials (we used host `/tmp`, port `8888`).

### 3. Start the frontend

```bash
cd hotel-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000`.
